# A Students Guide to Starting on Azure #
Students whose professors have an Azure Educator Grant can follow these directions to get started

## Activate Azure ##
1. Find the invite email
	*  Search your inbox for an email from [invites@microsoft.com](invites@microsoft.com "invites@microsoft.com")
	![the email will look like this](http://i.imgur.com/UWM9PU2.png)

2. Open Get Started in an In Private/Incognito browser 
	* NOTE: Safari doesn't work well with Azure. I recommend Chrome or FireFox.

5. Once it's done processing, you'll be redirected to http://portal.azure.com (if not, navigate there in a new tab).  **Make sure that you have the proper directory selected.** You can do this by clicking on your name, and looking for the directory which is for your class.

## How To Check Your Credits ##
Your professor likely allocated you a certain amount of credits for your projects. Follow these directions to check how much you have remaining.
**NOTE:** Azure doesn't bill on weekends, if you run VMs, etc over the weekend credits won't show up as being used until about 1am on Monday.

1. Navigate to [https://www.microsoftazuresponsorships.com/](https://www.microsoftazuresponsorships.com/ "https://www.microsoftazuresponsorships.com/") and click on Manage Academic Accounts. You must be logged in with the same email address your professor used to allocate credits
